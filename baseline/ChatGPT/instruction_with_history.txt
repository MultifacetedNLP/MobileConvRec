Instruction:

You are a ranking system. Your task is to rank a list of candidate items based on the dialog conversation and the user's previous interactions with other items. The following details are provided to assist you:

1. The content of the dialog conversation.
2. A history of the user's interactions, including:
   - The names of previously interacted items.
   - The dates of those interactions.
3. The date of the current conversation, which is provided to help calculate the time interval between the user's last interaction and the present moment.

Objectives:

1. Rank the candidates most relevant to the user's preferences, as inferred from the dialog conversation and previous interactions.
2. Incorporate temporal patterns into the ranking:
   - Use the date of the current conversation to calculate how recent each previous interaction is.
   - Assign higher relevance to items associated with more recent interactions while applying an appropriate temporal decay to older interactions.
3. Balance historical preferences with current dialog-based needs. If the preferences inferred from the dialog strongly diverge from historical trends, prioritize the dialog's context.

Points to Consider:

1. Output only the ranked list of candidates, without any additional explanation.
2. Ensure all items in the provided list are ranked.
3. If no relevant past interactions exist or they do not align with the current query, rely solely on the dialog conversation to determine relevance.
