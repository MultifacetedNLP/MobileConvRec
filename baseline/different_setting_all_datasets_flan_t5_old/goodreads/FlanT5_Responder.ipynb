I\\'ll look for another book.\\nComputer: Okay. What do you think about checking out \"The Cad and the Co-ed (Rugby, #3)\" by L.H. Cosway and Penny Reid?\\nHuman: I\\'m curious about the book you recommended, but can you tell me if there are any major issues with it?\\nComputer: Based on a number of user reviews, some readers found the secret in the book to be unbelievable and had issues with the setting being quite unrealistic.\\nHuman: Thanks for the suggestion, but I\\'m not comfortable with the reported unbelievable secret.\\nComputer: Understood. Another option you might like is \"The Witness\" by Nora Roberts. Would you like to learn more about it?\\nHuman: I\\'ve been considering the book you recommended, but I really dislike forced romance and stories that lack a good climax. Is this book going to disappoint me?\\nComputer: Based on numerous user reviews, the book does include a forced romance and has been criticized for its lack of a compelling climax, which might not meet your expectations.\\nHuman: I\\'m cautious about the reported forced romance and lack of climax. Do you have other suggestions?\\nComputer: In this situation, I\\'d recommend reading \"Standing Up\" by Kate Forest.\\nHuman: Can you give me some more details on \"Standing Up,\" please?\\nComputer: It offers strong character development, realistic struggles, and a heartwarming love story.\\nHuman: That sounds great! I\\'ll give \"Standing Up\" a read. Thank you for the recommendation!\\n',\n",
